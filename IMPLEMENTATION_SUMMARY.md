The system now clearly demonstrates how different subscription types provide varying levels of visibility on the homepage.

## ‚úÖ What Was Accomplished

### 1. **30 Premium Vendors Created**
- **6 VIP Platinum** (Priority 4 - Highest tier)
- **8 VIP Gold** (Priority 3 - High tier)
- **8 VIP Silver** (Priority 2 - Mid tier)
- **8 VIP Bronze** (Priority 1 - Entry tier)

Each vendor includes:
- Realistic business names and descriptions
- Geographic locations across Ghana (regions, districts, towns)
- Professional services with pricing
- Portfolio images (4-5 per vendor)
- Customer reviews for high-rated vendors
- Mix of verified and non-verified status

### 2. **Enhanced Visual Hierarchy**

Created distinct visual identities for each subscription tier:

| Tier | Border | Badge | Shadow | Crown |
|------|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| **Platinum** | Purple | Purple-Pink Gradient | Extra Large | üëë |
| **Gold** | Gold | Yellow-Gold Gradient | Large | üëë |
| **Silver** | Gray | Gray Gradient | Medium | üëë |
| **Bronze** | Orange | Orange Gradient | Small | üëë |
| **Free** | Gray | None | None | - |

### 3. **Smart Ranking Algorithm**

Implemented weighted scoring system:
- **40% VIP Priority Level** (Platinum=40, Gold=30, Silver=20, Bronze=10)
- **30% Verification Status** (Verified=30, Not Verified=0)
- **20% Customer Rating** (5.0‚òÖ = 20 points)
- **10% Review Count** (More reviews = higher score, capped at 10)

**Result:** Platinum verified vendors with 5‚òÖ ratings score 95+ points and appear first!

### 4. **Updated Components**

Enhanced two key Blade components:
- `vendor-card.blade.php` - Used in vendor listings
- `vendor-card-infinite.blade.php` - Used for homepage infinite scroll

Both now feature:
- Dynamic border colors based on VIP tier
- VIP badge in top-right corner with crown emoji
- Enhanced shadows for premium tiers
- Verification badge (blue checkmark)
- Responsive design for mobile
