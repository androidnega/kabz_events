# ðŸŽ‰ KABZS EVENT - Phase C Complete!

**Phase:** Authenticated Vendor Details + Access Rules  
**Status:** âœ… 100% COMPLETE  
**Overall:** 99% Complete  

---

## âœ… **PHASE C SUCCESS!**

Vendor detail pages now have **authentication-based access control**! Guests see limited info with login prompts, while authenticated users see full details.

## ðŸŽ¯ **What Was Implemented**

**Access Control Logic:**
- âœ… `canAccessSensitive` flag in VendorProfileController
- âœ… Shows contact info only to logged-in users
- âœ… Shows reviews/rating forms only to authenticated users
- âœ… Guest users see friendly login/signup prompts

**Security:**
- âœ… Review routes already protected by `auth` middleware
- âœ… Sensitive data hidden from guests
- âœ… Professional UX for unauthenticated visitors
