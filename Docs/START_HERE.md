$user = User::create([
    'name' => 'Admin User',
    'email' => 'admin@kabzsevent.com',
    'password' => bcrypt('password123'),
    'email_verified_at' => now(),

$user->assignRole('admin');

echo "Admin created: admin@kabzsevent.com / password123";
exit
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Docker not running
```bash
# Start Docker Desktop application first
# Wait for it to fully start
# Then run: ./vendor/bin/sail up -d
```

### Issue: Port 80 already in use
```bash
# Stop XAMPP/Apache if running
# Or change port in docker-compose.yml to 8080
```

### Issue: Permission errors
```bash
# Linux/Mac:
sudo chmod -R 775 storage bootstrap/cache

# Windows: Run as Administrator
```

### Issue: Composer not found
```bash
# Use Laravel Sail method instead (doesn't require local Composer)
# See QUICK_START.md Option A
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Use Sail Alias**: Makes commands shorter
   ```bash
   alias sail='./vendor/bin/sail'
   ```

2. **Keep Terminal Open**: Don't close terminal running `npm run dev`

3. **Check Logs**: When something breaks:
   ```bash
   ./vendor/bin/sail logs -f
   ```

4. **Use Tinker**: For quick testing:
   ```bash
   ./vendor/bin/sail artisan tinker
   ```

5. **Git from Day 1**: Initialize repository early
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```
