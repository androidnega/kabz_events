✅ ISSUE RESOLVED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PROBLEM: 
Vendor preview images were changing on every page refresh because they used 
picsum.photos with the "random" parameter.

SOLUTION:
Changed from random images to seed-based images that remain consistent.


📝 WHAT WAS CHANGED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. UPDATED SEEDER FILES
   ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

   File: database/seeders/PremiumVendorsSeeder.php
   
   BEFORE:
   'preview_image' => "https://picsum.photos/800/600?random=12345"
   'sample_work_images' => [
       "https://picsum.photos/800/600?random=123451",
       "https://picsum.photos/800/600?random=123452",
       ...
   ]
   
   AFTER:
   'preview_image' => "https://picsum.photos/seed/vendor1234-preview/800/600"
   'sample_work_images' => [
       "https://picsum.photos/seed/vendor1234-1/800/600",
       "https://picsum.photos/seed/vendor1234-2/800/600",
       ...
   ]


   File: database/seeders/DummyVendorsSeeder.php
   
   BEFORE:
   'profile_photo' => "https://picsum.photos/600/400?random=1"
   'work_samples' => [
       "https://picsum.photos/600/400?random=101",
       ...
   ]
   
   AFTER:
   'profile_photo' => "https://picsum.photos/seed/dummy-vendor-1/600/400"
   'work_samples' => [
       "https://picsum.photos/seed/dummy-vendor-1-1/600/400",
       ...
   ]


2. UPDATED EXISTING VENDORS
   ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

   Ran update script that fixed all 31 existing premium vendors:
   
   • Changed preview_image URLs from random to seed-based
   • Changed sample_work_images URLs from random to seed-based
   • Each vendor now has a unique seed based on their vendor ID
   • Images will remain consistent across page refreshes


🔍 HOW IT WORKS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PICSUM.PHOTOS SEED PARAMETER:

The /seed/ parameter tells picsum.photos to always return the same image for
the same seed value:

https://picsum.photos/seed/{UNIQUE_SEED}/{WIDTH}/{HEIGHT}

Example:
• https://picsum.photos/seed/vendor123-preview/800/600
  → Always returns the same image for "vendor123-preview"

• https://picsum.photos/seed/vendor123-1/800/600
  → Always returns the same image for "vendor123-1"

• https://picsum.photos/seed/vendor456-preview/800/600
  → Returns a different (but consistent) image for "vendor456-preview"


SEED NAMING PATTERN:

For Premium Vendors:
• Preview: "vendor{uniqueSuffix}-preview"
• Images: "vendor{uniqueSuffix}-1", "vendor{uniqueSuffix}-2", etc.

For Dummy Vendors:
• Preview: "dummy-vendor-{i}"
• Images: "dummy-vendor-{i}-1", "dummy-vendor-{i}-2", etc.


✅ RESULTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✓ 31 existing vendors updated with consistent images
✓ PremiumVendorsSeeder now creates vendors with seed-based images
✓ DummyVendorsSeeder now creates vendors with seed-based images
✓ All new vendors will have consistent images
✓ Cache cleared to ensure changes are visible immediately


🎯 VERIFICATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

To verify the fix:

1. Visit your homepage
2. Note the vendor images displayed
3. Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
4. Verify that the same images appear

✓ Images should NO LONGER change on refresh
✓ Each vendor has unique, but consistent, images
✓ Different vendors have different images
✓ Same vendor always shows same images

📚 TECHNICAL NOTES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHY PICSUM.PHOTOS?
• Free placeholder image service
• No API key required
• Supports seed-based consistent images
• Good for development/testing

FOR PRODUCTION:
Consider uploading real vendor images to:
• Local storage (storage/app/public/vendors/)
• Cloud storage (Cloudinary, AWS S3, etc.)
• Your own image server

UNSPLASH URLS:
Note: Some seeders use Unsplash URLs like:
https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1519741497674-611481863552?w=800&h=600

These are FINE and don't need to be changed because they use specific photo
IDs, which always return the same image.
