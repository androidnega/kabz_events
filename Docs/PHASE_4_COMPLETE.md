## 📊 Data Display Logic

### Categories
```php
$categories = Category::orderBy('display_order')
    ->take(10)
    ->get();
```

### Featured Vendors
```php
// Try to get featured verified vendors first
$featuredVendors = Vendor::where('is_verified', true)
    ->orderBy('rating_cached', 'desc')
    ->take(6)
    ->with('services.category')
    ->get();

// Fallback to latest verified vendors if none featured
if ($featuredVendors->isEmpty()) {
    $featuredVendors = Vendor::where('is_verified', true)
        ->latest()
        ->take(6)
        ->with('services.category')
        ->get();
}
```

**Optimizations:**
- Eager loading: `with('services.category')` prevents N+1 queries
- Limit to 6 vendors for performance
- Only shows verified vendors (is_verified = true)
- Ordered by rating for quality
